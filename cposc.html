    <p>The Central Pennsylvania Open Source Conference (CPOSC) is a one-day
      technical conference for open source users and developers.
      Presentations and sessions cover all aspects of open source, with
      talks ranging from novice to expert skill levels and featuring case
      studies, best practices, code-alongs and more. Join us for a day of
      meeting with and learning from your technology peers.</p>

      <div class="why">
        <h2>Why CPOSC?</h2>
        <p>Technology is evolving with unprecedented speed, which means it's
          more important than ever for those on the front lines of tech to
          gather, converse and share their experiences. CPOSC offers
          technologists passionate about open source technologies that very
          opportunity through presentations, panel discussions, lightning
          talks, informal designated conversation topic areas, and more.</p>

      <div class="DL">
        <h2>Why Downtown Lancaster?</h2>
        <p>As Downtown Lancaster's arts, music, and dining scenes have
          garnered national recognition over the past decade, we firmly
          believe that the Lancaster tech scene is in the midst of its own
          big boom. By moving downtown beginning in 2016, we wanted CPOSC to
          be at the center of this tech explosion. As a bonus, it's an easy
          walk from the Ware Center to the CPOSC After Party at \Tellus360\!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="what">
        <h2>What to expect:</h2>
        <p>Since its start, CPOSC has featured experienced technologists
          speaking on a variety of open source topics, from introduction
          level to deep dives and from emerging technologies to those
          tried-and-tested. You can also find stories of lessons learned
          with OSS, as well as niche industries like open source hardware.
          There is something for everyone at CPOSC.</p>
